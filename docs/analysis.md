# DikaFood CMS Component Analysis

## Overview
The DikaFood CMS (Content Management System) is a React-based admin interface that provides business operations management for the DikaFood platform, including content management, order processing, and user administration.

## Architecture
- **Framework**: React.js
- **Build Tool**: Create React App
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Styling**: SASS
- **Icons**: React Icons
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io Client

## Key Dependencies
- `react`: UI library
- `react-dom`: React DOM renderer
- `react-router-dom`: Page routing
- `react-icons`: Icon library
- `sass`: Styling pre-processor
- `socket.io-client`: Real-time communication with the backend
- `react-scripts`: Development and build tools from Create React App

## Key Files and Directories
- `src/`: Main source code
- `public/`: Static assets
- `package.json`: Project configuration and dependencies

## Application Structure
- Single-page application with client-side routing
- Component-based architecture
- Integration with the backend API for CRUD operations
- Real-time updates via Socket.io

## Build Process
- Development server via Create React App
- Production build with optimizations

## Notes
- The presence of Socket.io client suggests real-time features like:
  - Live order notifications
  - Inventory updates
  - User activities monitoring
- Uses the Create React App toolchain, in contrast to the Vite-based shop and landing components
- React Icons used rather than Phosphor Icons (used in other components)
- The full directory structure of src/ would provide more insight into the specific admin features implemented
